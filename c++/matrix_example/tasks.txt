Add support for basic operators (+, -, *, (r, c) etc) in Matrix<T> class. 
Matix<T> class is added as a header only C++ library.

Build instructions
   1. Create a folder named 'build' in examples folder
   2. Open a cmd terminal cd into examples/build folder
   3. Run cmake .. in cmd terminal
   4. Open examples/build/examples.sln using 'Visual Studio'
   5. Set example1 as startup project

Task 1: 
Add support for element access operator matrix(row, col). Basic code skeleton exists in examples/matrix/matrix.h file.
Set startup project to access_elements_test. Make sure the test passes.

Task 2:
Add support for serialization and deserialization operators.
Set startup project to serialize_deserialize_test. Make sure the test passes.

Task 3:
Add support for matrix addition. Set startup project to add_test. Make sure the test passes.

Task 4:
Add support for matrix multiplication. Set startup project to multiply_test. Test need to pass.

Task 5:
Add support for matrix transpose. Set startup project to transpose_test. Test need to pass.

Task 6:
Add support for matrix subtraction operator. Add unit tests for subtraction.

Task 7.
Add support for matrix scalar multiplication operator. Add unit tests.
